= How to use =

* Make a backup of your database! In case you import to much trash to wrong places and assign the values to wrong fields.
* Install REST Importer and go to "Tools" -> "REST Importer" -> "Sources", add a source and save.
* Switch to tab "Requests & Import", add a request, choose the source, select "Print as admin notice" and push the "Request/Import" button. On success, you'll see the response as some kind of tree structure.
* Switch to tab "Value Mapping" add a "Map" and customize the way the data gets imported. Rebuild the the response structure and assign the nodes to post/user options and meta-options.
* Switch to tab "Requests & Import", edit the request and select "Save response".
